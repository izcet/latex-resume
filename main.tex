      \bpt Self-taught the internals of the Firefox web browser. Built tools, tailored task-oriented profiles, and utilized enterprise policies to harden the browser's privacy features.

      \bpt Wrote an \href{https://github.com/izcet/--.bf/blob/main/--.bf}{esoteric program} in a minimal instruction set language.

      % \bpt Won the Recurse Center's Halloween costume contest as The Installation Wizard. Burned more than a terabyte of data to thumbdrives as bootable linux ISOs, with the project files, security tools, and my contact information as a discoverable easter egg.
      % \bpt Self-taught Firejail, the app sandboxing

      % I think these look bad as the only technical points to have for (what appears to be) a year of sabbatical.
      % Should I leave them out, move the git brag to the Projects/Sludge Game text?

    \cveventtwo{Security Engineer, Android Security Operations ~•~ Google}{2022--2024}{Mountain View \color{cvred}}{
      \bpt Led malware/policy investigations for apps and SDKs on the Google Play Store, involving reverse engineering,
      unpacking, deobfuscation, and creating automated detection.

      \bpt Increased code coverage of sensitive API abuse through integrating static analysis, dynamic analysis, and internal tooling. The increased coverage immediately detected previously-unknown malicious SDks, which I triaged, investigated, and removed from Play. 

      \bpt Identified privacy risks and data collection behaviors on the Google Play Store.

      \bpt Provided technical expertise to management, legal, and cross-functional teams during sensitive escalations.
      %\bpt Maintained a dashboard of ongoing detections, investigations, coverage, and enforcement of apps and SDKs, which provided a single source of truth artifact for cross-functional organization.

    \cveventtwo{Security Intelligence Engineer ~•~ Lookout}{2018-2022}{Boston \color{cvred}}{
      \bpt Maintained a realtime static analysis pipeline that analyzed hundreds of millions of mobile apps across iOS and Android, and automated threat detection.

      \bpt Completely owned and maintained the service architecture, from software development, code review, automated testing, build verification, staging and production checks, through metrics reporting, post-deployment monitoring, and on-call incident response.

      \bpt Added IAM security policies and network access rules across the fleet of instances. 

      \bpt Rotated signing keys used by the security OTA update infrastructure on a regular cadence.

      \bpt Wrote tests to prevent data loss, adding DB schema backward compatibility checks.

      \bpt Created a tool for surfacing insecure coding practices, such as hardcoded API credentials, in apps analyzed by the security platform.

      \bpt Reverse engineered malicious apps as necessary to improve the analysis engine.

      \bpt Won first place in the 2021 company-wide \href{https://www.securecodewarrior.com/}{Secure Code Warrior} challenge competition.

    \cveventtwo{Internship ~•~ OtoSense / Analog Devices}{2018}{Palo Alto \color{cvred}}{\bpt Created a CLI visualizer for audio input, used on headless remote devices over SSH.

    \bpt Processed CAN bus data in embedded C, and used Python to integrate with classical ML anomaly detection systems.

    \bpt Implemented a handheld touch UI for a single-board computer used in customer demos.
